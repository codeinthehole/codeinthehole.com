purl, URI templates and generated tests
=======================================
----------------------------------------------------------------
Matching the RFC using Nose's test generators :: python, testing
----------------------------------------------------------------

*TLDR*: Parameterised tests are a useful testing technique.  Both Nose and
py.test support them.

URI templates in purl
---------------------

The newly released `purl 0.8`_ (a URL library of mine) supports URI templates as per
`RFC 6570`_.  These allow new URL instances to be created by passing bindings to
a template instance.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import purl
    >>> tpl = purl.Template('http://www.google.com{path}')
    >>> tpl.expand({'path': ['a', 'b', 'c']}).as_string()
    'http://www.google.com/a/b/c'

Alternatively, you can expand template strings directly:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> purl.expand('{?list*}', {'list': ['a', 'b', 'c']})
    '/a/b/c'

There's a plethora of ways template URLs can be used - see the RFC_ for details.

.. _RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570
.. _`RFC 6570`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570

.. warning::

    Note, there's `already a Python library that provides this functionality`_.  I
    decided not to use that one with purl as I thought I could do better.  Plus,
    it looked like fun and I wanted to learn more about Python's support for
    parameterised tests.

Parameterised tests
-------------------

I'd like to draw your attention to parameterised, or generated, tests which were
used to drive development of this feature.

Example
~~~~~~~

The RFC includes a range of example templates, bindings and
expected outputs:

.. image:: /static/images/screenshots/rfc6570.png

These are excellent material for driving a series of parametric tests since
each example comprises the inputs and expected output for a test.  The natural
way to test such examples is using parameterised tests.

PHPUnit
~~~~~~~

PHP's dominant testing libary, PHPUnit_, support `data providers`_
that can used to solve this problem (in a slightly clunky way).  

There's a Python port of this functionality in `django-oscar's testing utilities`_
(and many other places no doubt) however there's better way to write
parameterised tests in Python.

.. _`django-oscar's testing utilities`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar/blob/master/oscar/test/decorators.py#L4-L27

Nose
~~~~

I used `Nose's test generators`_ to drive TDD on purl.

These allow tests to be generated by ``yield``ing a tuple
``(test_fn, *test_args)`` for each dataset. Here, ``test_fn`` is a callable that
takes arguments ``test_args`` and should raise an ``AssertionError`` if the
test fails.

Consider the above snippet from section 3.2.2 of the RFC: tests for this section
can be constructed as:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import purl
    from nose.tools import eq_

    level1_vars = {
        'var': 'value',
        'hello': 'Hello World!',
    }

    # Tuples of (template, bindings, expected URI)
    test_data = [
        ('{var}', level1_vars, 'value'),
        ('{hello}', level1_vars, 'Hello%20World%21'),
    ]

    def assert_expansion(template, fields, expected):
        eq_(purl.expand(template, fields), expected)

    def test_expansion():
        for template, fields, expected in test_data:
            yield assert_expansion, template, fields, expected

which executes each example as a single test:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ nosetests tests/expansion_tests.py
    tests.expansion_tests.test_expansion('{var}', {'var': 'value', 'hello': 'Hello World!'}, 'value') ... ok
    tests.expansion_tests.test_expansion('{hello}', {'var': 'value', 'hello': 'Hello World!'}, 'Hello%20World%21') ... ok

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

    OK

.. note::

    I have verbose output turned on by default since my ``~/nose.cfg`` file
    contains the line ``verbosity=2``.

Here we construct a simple assertion function using the ``eq_`` equality check
from Nose's test tools.

The default verbose output is a little too verbose for my tastes.  It can be
cleaned up by providing a ``description`` attribute on the yielded
callable:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_expansion():
        for template, fields, expected in test_data:
            assert_expansion.description = "%s expands to %s" % (template, expected)
            yield assert_expansion, template, fields, expected

which looks like:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ nosetests tests/expansion_tests.py
    {var} expands to value ... ok
    {hello} expands to Hello%20World%21 ... ok

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

    OK

Much nicer.

.. warning::

    Updating the description suffers from a known bug where `failure reports
    always use the last description assigned to callable`_.  There are a few
    work-arounds detailed in the bug comments but none play nicely with
    Nose's multiprocess plugin.

py.test
~~~~~~~

In researching this post, I discovered `py.test`_ supports a `rich array of
functionality`_ for creating parameterised or generated tests.

Using py.test's ``@pytest.mark.parameterize`` decorator_, we can rewrite the
above example as:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import pytest

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(("template", "fields", "expected"), data)
    def test_expand(template, fields, expected):
        assert expand(template, fields) ==  expected

with verbose output:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ py.test -v tests/pytest_tests.py
    platform darwin -- Python 2.7.2 -- pytest-2.3.5 -- /Users/dwinterbottom/.virtualenvs/purl/bin/python
    collected 2 items

    tests/pytest_tests.py:123: test_expand[{var}-fields0-value] PASSED
    tests/pytest_tests.py:123: test_expand[{hello}-fields1-Hello%20World%21] PASSED

I have a feeling I will be switching to py.test shortly.

Summary
-------

Test generators are a useful addition to your testing toolkit.

There's a couple of things to be aware of when using Nose's generated tests:

* It's not possible to run just one of the examples from the commandline.

* It's tempting to create the assertion function inline within the ``test_*``
  function.  However this doesn't work if you run your tests across multiple
  processes using Nose's ``--processes`` option.

Here's a few examples of using this functionality:

* The `expanded version of the above example from the Purl library`_

* `A set of tests from django-oscar`_ for testing validation of the Luhn algorithm.
