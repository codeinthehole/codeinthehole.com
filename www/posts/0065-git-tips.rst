Notes from an internal git workshop :: git, commandlinefu
---------------------------------------------------------

I work at `an agency`_ where we pay $200 a month to Github for their `platinum
plan`_.  This article is a summary of an internal talk I gave on making the most
of our subscription.

There's nothing original here: it's just a collection of tips that I've
harvested over the last few years.  I'm publishing this article mainly so I have
something to refer future employees to.

Use pull requests
=================

Pull requests are an excellent tool for fostering code review.  If you're using
Github for team projects, you should be using these extensively. 

Many people don't realise that you can make pull requests between two branches
of the same repository (the so-called `"shared repository model"`_).  For team
projects, this is preferable over the "fork and pull" model because it's
simpler: there are less branches and remotes to keep track of.

.. _`"shared repository model"`: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

A good practice is for someone else to merge your code into the mainline,
ensuring 2 sets of eyeballs review each feature.  This is simple to organise
when working in pairs, but in larger teams you may need a system for determining
who reviews what.

Sample workflow
---------------

Here's a sample workflow demonstrating the use of pull requests.

Work on a story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new branch for the current story you are working on:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (master) $ git checkout -b feature/masquerading

It's important to use a new branch for pull requests for several reasons:

* It allows you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion.  The
  classical Github gotcha is to continue committing to a pull request branch
  after making the initial request.  When these commits are pushed to the
  remote, they will become part of the original pull request which often ends up
  conflating unrelated functionality.  

* When your pull request is merged into the target branch, the maintainer may
  decide to rebase your commits to avoid a merge commit, or to squash the
  commits into a single coherent commit.  If your pull request was from your
  'master' branch, you will encounter problems when merging the target branch back
  into your own 'master'.  Using a temporary branch means it can be discarded once
  the pull request is accepted and it doesn't matter that your history was
  rewritten.

Make changes, run tests, commit etc.  

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ vim 
    (feature/masquerading) $ git commit

Ask for feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If it's a significant or difficult story, you may be unsure if you're on the
right track.  You could ask for some feedback now by pushing your commits to the
remote for others to review:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git push -u origin feature/masquerading

The ``-u`` option adds an upstream tracking reference to your local branch, meaning that
you can run push subsequent commits using ``git push`` without having to specify
the remote and branch names (and run ``git pull`` without additional arguments).

Now ask for feedback on your project mailing list by circulating either a link
to the branch, or a compare view URL.  You can use the excellent `hub`_ to
easily generate compare URLs for sharing:

.. _`hub`: http://defunkt.io/hub/

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (master) $ git compare master..feature/masquerading

This will open your default browser on the compare URL, which you can then copy
into an email.

Your fellow developers can now comment either on your commits at line-level,
or make more general comments by replying to the mailing list thread.

Submit pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After digesting your co-workers' comments, you adjust your approach and make
some further commits to your branch.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ vim 
    (feature/masquerading) $ git commit

When the story is complete, push your new commits to the remote:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git push 

and use the Github site to create a pull request.  A couple of things to be
aware of:

* Make sure the destination branch is correct, it may not always be 'master'.  If
  you're using git-flow or similar, the appropriate destination branch may be
  'develop' or a release branch.

* Use Github's preview facilties to ensure the pull request is well structured
  and clear.  The description should explain what the pull request contains as
  well as the thinking behind it.  For reference, have a look at this `excellent
  pull request`_.

.. _`excellent pull request`: https://github.com/bitly/dablooms/pull/19

Once the pull request is created, you should find someone on your team to review
it and send them a link to the request using the project mailing list so anyone else
with an interest can take a look.

Code review
~~~~~~~~~~~

Others can now review your branch, make comments on individual lines or on the
pull request as a whole: the same process as when you pushed some commits for
review earlier.

It's also possible for others to add commits to the pull request by pushing to
the same branch:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (master) $ git fetch origin
    (master) $ git checkout feature/masquerading
    (feature/masquerading) $ vim 
    (feature/masquerading) $ git add .
    (feature/masquerading) $ git commit
    (feature/masquerading) $ git push origin feature/masquerading

Iterate this way until the branch is ready to be merged.

.. warning::

    Github easter egg: add ``?w=0`` to diff URLs (eg a commit, compare view or pull
    request) to ignore whitespace.

Cleaning your history (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're ready to merge, you should first clean up the feature branch.

If there are any commits on the destination branch that aren't on your feature
branch then you should rebase to avoid a merge commit.  You can check for such
commits using:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git log ..master

This shows all commits on 'master' that aren't in your current branch history.  If
you see any commits here, then rebase the feature branch using:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git rebase master

This replays your commits on top of the new commits from the destination branch
so that the merge can be a 'fast-forward'.

.. warning::

    Hang on!  Aren't you rewriting history that has been pushed?  

    Yes - that's true.  However, when the remote branch is *temporary* as for a
    pull request, this is ok (as far as I can tell).  The pull request branch
    should be deleted once it has been merged and so it shouldn't matter that
    its history is being rewritten before merging.  

Next, it may be desirable to squash your commits into larger cohesive commits.
You can do this using an 'interactive' rebase:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git rebase -i master

This will open ``$EDITOR`` with all commits since 'master' listed.  You can then
reorder and squash these commits, as well as rewording the commit messages.  Be
careful, this can become quite addictive.

One thing you can do is adjust the final commit message on your feature branch
to close the pull request automatically.  Simply add 'Fixes #123' (using the ID
from the pull request URL) at the bottom of the message.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git commit --amend

Merging
~~~~~~~

Finally, you can merge your cleaned-up feature branch with a fast-forward
merge:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git checkout master
    (master) $ git merge feature/masquerading

Alternatively, you can force a merge commit to keep track of which commits came
from the feature branch.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (feature/masquerading) $ git checkout master
    (master) $ git merge --no-ff feature/masquerading

When you view the your history as a graph, you will be able to tell which
commits were from the feature branch.

Now delete the local and remote feature branches:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    (master) $ git branch -D feature/masquerading
    (master) $ git push origin :feature/masquerading

Other good practices
====================

Care about your history
-----------------------

Strive for a clean, coherent history.  Write `good commit messages`_, adhering
to the 50 char summary followed by a longer description.  Avoid unneccessary
merge commits as they clutter up your history.

As we saw above, if you haven't pushed your branch to a stable remote branch,
you can rewrite it:

* Use ``git rebase`` to rebase your feature branch against the branch you intend
  to merge into.  This means that when you merge, it will be a so-called 'fast
  forward' merge which avoids a merge commit.

* Use ``git rebase -i`` to rewrite your branch history, squashing related
  commits, rewording commit messages.

.. _`good commit messages`: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

Build an audit trail
--------------------

Try and build a good audit trail - your future self will be grateful.  Where
possible cross-reference other resources in your commit messages.  These could
be:

* Github pull requests or issues (eg "Related to #123")
* Mailing-list threads that discuss the work in question (try and use mailing
  list software that lets you link to a discussion).  If you use
  Basecamp or something similar, link to the relevant discussion.
* Articles or blog posts relevant to your work

Basically anything that might be useful 12 months later when you're trying to
work out the reasoning behind some component.

One thing, I try to do with django-oscar_ (a project of mine) is to maintain an
audit trail from a commit all the way back to the mailing list discussion that
instigated it.  This works as follows:

.. _django-oscar: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar

* If you're puzzled by a particular line within a file, use ``git blame`` to
  find the commit that introduced it.
* The commit message should explain the change that led to this line and link
  back to a pull request.
* The pull request should be a set of related commits that together implement a new feature. 
  The pull request description should be a functional spec for the feature in
  question, together with a link to the mailing list thread where this feature
  was discussed.
  
I haven't been following this process for long, but it seems to work well.

Use your prompt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Put relevant git information into your prompt - this will make your life easier.
Here's a bash snippet for adding the current git branch to your prompt:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # ~/.bashrc
    function parse_git_branch {
        git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1) /'
    }
    PS1="\[\e[32m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[34m\]\h:\W \$ \[\e[m\]"
    export PS1

Use aliases for speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Strive to be as productive as possible at the commandline.  For me, that means
minimising key strokes.

With git, you can define both git- and bash-aliases to make your life easier.  I
have lots (listed below).  Two are worth highlighting: 

1. I alias ``git status -sb`` to ``g`` so I can quickly check git status.  This
   is my most frequently typed command so it makes sense to make it easy.

2. Like many others, I use a customised version of ``git log`` that lists one
   commit per line, but annotated with other useful information such as which
   commits other branches point to.  See the definition of ``git hist`` below.

Selected aliases from ``~/.gitconfig``:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [alias]
        hist = log --color --pretty=format:\"%C(yellow)%h%C(reset) %s%C(bold red)%d%C(reset) %C(green)%ad%C(reset) %C(blue)[%an]%C(reset)\" --relative-date --decorate
        unstage = reset HEAD --
        restore = checkout --
        cn = commit --no-verify
        co = checkout
        praise = blame
        visualise = !gitk
        graph = log --color --graph --pretty=format:\"%h | %ad | %an | %s%d\" --date=short

And from ``~/.bash_aliases``:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    alias git='hub'
    alias g='git status -sb'
    alias gh='git hist'
    alias gp='git pull'
    alias gpr='git pull --rebase'
    alias gpp='git pull --rebase && git push'
    alias gf='git fetch'
    alias gb='git branch'
    alias ga='git add'
    alias gc='git commit'
    alias gca='git commit --amend'
    alias gcv='git commit --no-verify'
    alias gd='git diff --color-words'
    alias gdc='git diff --cached -w'
    alias gdw='git diff --no-ext-diff --word-diff'
    alias gdv='git diff'
    alias gl='git log --oneline --decorate'
    alias gt='git tag'
    alias grc='git rebase --continue'
    alias grs='git rebase --skip'
    alias gsl='git stash list'
    alias gss='git stash save'
