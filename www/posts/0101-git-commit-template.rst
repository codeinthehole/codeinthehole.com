=====================================
A useful template for commit messages
=====================================
-------------------------------------------------------------
A simple heuristic for preferring the imperative mood :: git 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a useful heuristic for writing better commit messages. Set your commit
message template to:

.. sourcecode:: text

    # If applied, this commit will...

    # Explain why this change is being made

    # Provide links to any relevant tickets, articles or other resources

and you'll be guided into writing concise commit subjects in the imperative
mood - a good practice.  See rule 5 of Chris Beam's `"How to write a commit message"`_ 
for the inspiration of this tip and more reasoning on the use of the imperative
mood.

To do this in Git, save the above content in a file (eg
``~/.git_commit_msg.txt``) and run:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ git config --global commit.template ~/.git_commit_msg.txt

Here's what this looks like in practice:

Try it - it's genuinely useful.
