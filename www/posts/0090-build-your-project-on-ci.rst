=================================
Continuously rebuild your project
=================================
-----------------------------------------------------
Using CI to avoid pain for new team members :: django
-----------------------------------------------------

New developers joining a project will often find that the project won't build
cleanly on their machine, and hours of time will be sunk into setting up the
project so work can start. This is sad and expensive for all concerned.

This is a particular menace in agencies (or anywhere with lots of small projects)
where a large team of developers need to jump between projects.  Tools like
Vagrant_ and Docker_ can help but aren't the panacea they first seem to be [*]_.

Counter this by using continuous integration to build your project from scratch.
Then any changes that break the build process (such as database schema changes
not applying correctly) will be spotted early. New team members will be dishing
out high-fives when their development environment is built and primed with
sample data sixty seconds after cloning the repo.

Tips
----

It should be trivial to get a project working locally.  At Tangent_, projects
use a ``makefile`` for common tasks.  Setting up a
working version of the project is as simple as:

.. _Tangent: http://www.tangentsnowball.com/

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ make 

It's helpful if you can template new projects to embed good practices like this.
We frequently use Django and maintain a `boilerplate Django project`_ for this
purpose.  It includes a `makefile`_ along these lines:

.. _`boilerplate Django project`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/tangent-django-boilerplate/
.. _makefile: https://github.com/tangentlabs/tangent-django-boilerplate/blob/master/makefile

.. sourcecode:: make

    # Build a working version of the project
    build: clean virtualenv database

    # Delete all temporary or untracked files
    clean: 
        -find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
        -rm -rf www/public/media/*

    # Update the virtualenv
    virtualenv: 
        pip install -r www/deploy/requirements.txt

    #Â Create a database populated with data
    database: 
        python www/manage.py reset_db --router=default --noinput
        python www/manage.py syncdb --noinput
        python www/manage.py migrate
        # Load any project fixtures to pre-populate the initial database
        python www/manage.py loaddata fixtures/*.json

    test:
        cd www && py.test

    ci: test database

Witness the ``ci`` target which runs the test suite *and* builds the database,
effectively smoke-testing that the migrations apply correctly and the fixtures
load (which is where we've historically had pain). 

We use Travis_ for CI and our template ``.travis.yml`` looks a little like this:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    language: python

    python:
      - '2.7'

    install:
      - make virtualenv

    # Use the same database as used in production
    before_script:
      - psql -c 'CREATE ROLE test_role login createdb superuser;' -U postgres
      - psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE test_db OWNER test_role;' -U postgres

    script:
      - make ci

.. _travis: https://travis-ci.com/

which means that, *by default*, all new projects will be built from scratch as
part of continuous integration. You should do this.  

Django-specific issues
----------------------

For the record, here's some of the build issues we've encountered in Django
projects (both internal and external)  Most stem from South migrations, which
worked fine when applied piecemeal by the incumbent team but fail when run on a blank
database. For instance:

* Migrations fail to apply as there are dependencies between migrations which
  haven't been captured.  This is easily solved by employing South's support for
  dependent migrations (eg adding ``depends_on`` to the relevant migration class).

* Migrations fail as they import models directly rather than using the
  reconstituted models that South provides. This is a beginner mistake really but
  still quite common. Fortunately, it's trivial to fix. 

* Migrations import and call functions that are no longer defined (but did exist
  when the migration was originally written).

* Migrations create instances of models from *other* apps where South's serialised
  version is out of sync with the database schema. This can be tricky to
  fix as you can get circular dependencies between migrations. Often you'll need
  to rewrite migrations to create models in the migrations of their own apps.

`Andrew Ingram`_ has written up an excellent summary of `common South pitfalls`_.
