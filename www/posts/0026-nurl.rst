nurl - an immutable URL object for node.js

A URL value object for node.js :: node, javascript
--------------------------------------------------

I'm a big fan of `Value Objects`_ - some of the most useful classes I've ever
written have been lightweight wrappers around strings.

For my first contribution to the `node.js`_ ecosystem, I've published a simple,
immutable URL object to the Node package manager (npm) directory. It provides a
light-weight, immutable URL object that encapsulates the functionality of the
existing 'url' and 'querystring' modules in a single object as well as offering
various extension methods that make working with URLs easy.

Source and detailed docs available at http://github.com/codeinthehole/nurl -
but here's some sample usage for dynamically building a URL:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    var nurl = require('nurl');
    var baseUrl = (new nurl.Url()).setProtocol('http')
                                  .setHostname('api.example.com')
                                  .setPathname('search');
    var searchUrl = baseUrl.setPathSegment(1, 'my search term');
    searchUrl.toString() // => 'http://api.example.com/search/my%20search%20term

All components of a URL are exposed as read-only properties as well as through
getter functions.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    var u = nurl.parse('http://www.example.com/path/to/somewhere?q=node.js');
    u.getSubdomains() // ['www', 'example', 'com']
    u.getPathSegment(0) // 'path'
    u.getQueryParam('q') // 'node.js'
    u.getQueryParam('p', 'a default value') // 'a default value'

All very simple but potentially quite useful thanks to the ubiquity of the humble URL.

Writing this module introduced me to some of the excellent software already
available for node.js. Firstly, the package management system `npm`_ is
brilliantly simple to get started with, and to publish modules for all to use.
Secondly, I'm a huge fan of the `Vows BDD package`_. Writing tests in javascript
offers some cunning possibilities such as dynamically building test-suites at
run-time - this is great for this package as I can create a fixture object of
URL strings and their decomposition into components, then build the context
dynamically.
