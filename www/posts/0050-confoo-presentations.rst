I gave two presentations at Confoo 2012 - below are the abstracts and slides.

Migrating from PHP to Python and Django
---------------------------------------

Abstract:

    Many programmers cut their teeth with PHP before getting interested in
    Python. However, while the languages seem similar at first, there are many
    new concepts to grasp and a rich ecosystem of tools to master. This isn't
    easy, but with the right advice, a strong PHP developer can become an
    excellent Python developer very quickly.

    Based on the experience of migrating a development team from PHP to Python
    and Django, this talk will examine how to tackle this journey. While the
    fundamental languages differences will be touched upon, this talk will focus
    on more interesting topics such as common python gotchas, tips for grokking
    Django, awesome tools and applications from the community, and how to manage
    such a migration for a large team of developers.

Writing a Django e-commerce framework
-------------------------------------

Abstract:

    Django is well-suited for e-commerce, and there are currently several
    nascent django e-commerce frameworks in development. This talk is about the
    development of django-oscar, a framework designed to leverage Django's core
    functionality to allow domain-driven e-commerce applications to be built.
    This is a very powerful approach.

    Writing django apps which are flexible enough to be adapted to a wide
    variety of scenarios is a non-trivial problem which will be explored. The talk will
    also cover a range of e-commerce best practices and how they can be implemented
    in Django.
